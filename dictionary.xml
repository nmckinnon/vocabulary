These cattle were so strong and healthy - in fact divinely so - that they produced huge heaps of dung every day, meaning that no one could ever clean out the stables properly. One of Hercule's 12 labours was to make these stables clean in just 24 hours; he succeeded in this by diverting the path of two rivers into the buildings, thus sweeping away the excrement. Today we continue to refer to any task that seems impossible as Augean.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. Most people find the UK government's tax system to be Byzantine.</example>
	  <etymology>The Byzantine Empire was the name for the Roman Empire between the 4th and 15th centuries AD. The Byzantine Empire was vast and sprawling and hence required a complex system of government, with thousands of different types of bureaucrats, all wearing different hats and outfits to denote their rank; it's no surprise that, in such as competitive environment, the most successful politicians were marked by their deviousness. Today, when we refer to an administration as Byzantine, we evoke this sense of unfathomable complexity as well as the deviousness of its creators.</etymology>

For Catholics, Lent is a time of austerity when luxuries such as meat are renounced - hence the etymology of the word carnival that derives from the Latin carne vale, meaning 'farewell to meat'; as the carnival is the last chance to celebrate and indulge oneself before Lent's rigours. Processions and masked dancers characterise a carnival and when we use the word carnivalesque, we refer to this spirit of celebration.</etymology>

Hence the horn came to be depicted by the Greeks as bursting with fruits and flowers and other treats that people desired; today we continue to use the word cornucopia to refer to any bountiful display of food and goodies.</etymology>

	  <etymology>Delphic has its derivation in the ancient Greek oracle at Delphi, whose priestess was said to have the power of prediction; however, her pronouncements were so ambiguous that it was very hard to work out what she meant. For example, the oracle once warned a warrior called Lysander to watch out for: 'a serpent...craftily creeping up behind you...'. Lysander was presumably ever alert for snakes after that but in the end was killed by a man who was standing being him at the time and who had a snake on his shield - so the oracle's warning, although truthful in a way, wasn't really helpful. Today we use the term Delphic to evoke any pronouncement that is similarly hard to understand.</etymology>

Today, society is more tolerant of such situatios and so the term demimonde no longer refers to women in this position, but continues to be used of people who are on the fringes of society, such as workers who are in the UK illegally.</etymology>

	  <etymology>deus ex machina derives from the Greek term theos ek mekhane (meaning 'god from the machinery') and referred to those actors who, because they represented gods, were suspended above the stage in Greek theatres. Eventually these actors would be lowered down and intervene in the events on the stage, thus bringing about the plays ending.

	  <etymology>Dickensian refers to the novels of Charles Dickens, which were works of social commentary, as the author was committed to exposing poverty in Victorian society. The publicity unleashed by Dicken's novel Oliver Twist (1838), for example, led to the eventual dismantlement of a slum called Jacob's Island that was the basis for the story.

	  <example>e.g. Critics say the Chinese government's statement - that 'China's internet is open and managed in accordance with the law' - is an example of doublethink.</example>
	  <etymology>doublethink is a concept invented by George Orwell in his novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.
	  Nineteen Eighty-Four describes a totalitarian government which exercises control over its subject via propaganda. Yet the risk remains for the ruling regime that the disgust felt by its own officials at this use of propaganda might lead to the collapse of the system. This is the reason that the ruling regime uses reality control to ensure everyone - even its own officials - remains wilfully ignorant of contradictions within the regime's use of propaganda. One of the reality control devices that officials are encouraged to use is doublethink, which, Orwell tells us, is the ability to hold 'two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneoulsy' while believing both to be correct. An example in the book is when civil servants rewrite government history and are then able to believe wholeheartedly in this new version of history that they themselves have just created. Today, we use the work doublethink to refer to any instance of someone wilfully ignoring contradictions in a belief system.</etymology>

	  <etymology>eldorado - which means 'the golden one' (El Dorado) in Spanish - refers to a mythical city of gold that the 16th-century Spanish conquistadors were told existed in the newly discovered Americas.   Spurred on by assurances from captive Indians that El Dorado overflowed with gold and precious gemstones, groups of Spaniards went out to find this place - but in vain, with many of them dying from diseases and attacks by the natives. Today, we use the word eldorado to signify a place where wealth can be acquired quickly (doubtless the founders of the world's biggest websites would describe the Internet as an eldorado). Eldorado can also be used to refer to a lifelong ambition (as as attaining happiness) and, in this way, it is similar to the word Shangir-La.</etymology>

	  <etymology>eminence grise is a French expression literally meaning 'grey eminence'.

	  <example>e.g. in the UK, politically neutral organisations define the boundaries of electoral constituencies so as to eliminate the risk of gerrymandering.</example>
	  <etymology>The verb gerrymander originated in the early 19th century, arising from the combination of the name of one Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts with the word 'salamander'. Seeing that his political party was about to lose an election, Governor Gerry signed a new bill into law that redrew the electoral boundaries to favour his party. This new area happened to include one district that was shaped like a salamander, a creature that looks like a newt. A journalist noted this resemblance and soon there appeared in The Boston Weekly Messenger a drawing of a salamander - but with claws and wings added to enhance the impression of evil at work - that was given the title The Gerry-mander (to evoke the name of the meddlesome Governor Gerry). Today we continue to use the word gerrymander to describe any attempt by a political party to draw up new voting districts to swing the vote its way.</etymology>

This theatre was a place of gore, staging horror shows; the success of each performance was gauged by the number of people who fainted. After the all too real horrors of World War II, demand for artificial horror subsided and the theatre closed. However, we still use the word today to refer to any play or film which uses gory special effects to shock.</etymology>

A good example occurs in one of the most famous novels of the 20th century: The Great Gatsby (1925). Jay Gatsby's harmatia is his unreciprecated love for a married lady called Daisy; when Daisy runs over and kills a woman by accident, Gatsby claims it is he who was responsible and, as a result, is murdered by the victim's husband.</etymology>

	  <name>harpy</name>
	  <meaning>a woman known for her grasping nature</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. If an attractive young woman marries a rich old man, society is quick to label the woman a harpy.</example>
	  <etymology>A harpy was in Greek mythology a flying creature with a woman's head but a monster's body. Harpies would descend from the sky and snatch food from the hands of humans on the ground: It is for this reason that the literal meaning of harpy (harpazein - to snatch in Greek) is 'someone who snatches'. Today we continue to refer to any grasping woman as a harpy.</etymology>
	  <pronunciation>harpy</pronunciation>

	  <meaning>advocating war or aggression</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Towards the end of his life, Elvis Presley amassed an arsenal of weapons - including 32 handguns - because chronic drug abuse had made him hawkish.</example>
	  <etymology>hawkish derives from 'hawk', a warlike bird; the direct opposite is dovish.</etymology>

	  <name>heterogeneous</name>
	  <meaning>made up of diverse units</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Aside from a love of tennis, it is hard to find commonality among the crowds at the Wimbledon tennis championships: they form a heterogeneous group.</example>
	  <etymology>The direct opposite of heterogeneous is homogeneous, meaning 'made up of units that exactly the same as each other'. For example, penguins are pretty much indistinguishable to humans; in other words, as far as we are concerned, these birds form a homogeneous mass.</etymology>
	  <pronunciation>heterogeneous</pronunciation>
  </word>
  <word> 
	  <name>hew to</name>
	  <meaning>to stick to</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Steven Spielberg's films - Jaws, for example - all hew to his action-packed vision of story-telling.</example>
	  <etymology>deriving from the 19th-century phrase 'to hew to the line', meaning 'to cut evenly with a saw'; this reconciles the German root, hauen: 'to cut' with the seemingly contradictory English expression 'to hew to', meaning 'to stick to'.</etymology>
	  <pronunciation>hew</pronunciation>

  <word> 
	  <name>hidebound</name>
	  <meaning>unwilling to adapt due to one's upbringing</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. In Romeo and Juliet, both sets of parents cannot accept the union of their progeny because they are hidebound by historical feuds with one another.</example>
	  <etymology>hidebound was first used in the 16th century to describe cattle that had been undernourished, which led to their skin clinging closely to their back and ribs (and in this sense, their innards were bound together by their hides alone). hidebound then evolved in meaning to refer to undernourished human beings, before assuming today's usage - which is 'undernourished in outlook' and thus 'unwilling to change'.</etymology>
	  <pronunciation>hidebound</pronunciation>

	  <name>highfalutin</name>
	  <meaning>(of language) grand-sounding</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Novels are divided into those that are commercial, such as The Divinci Code - and those that are considered highfalutin, such as Proust's works.</example>
	  <etymology>highfalutin derives from the words 'high' and 'fluting': together, these words mean 'to speak in a melodious way reminiscent of the sound of a flute'.</etymology>
	  <pronunciation>highfalutin</pronunciation>
  </word>
  <word>

  </word>
  <word> 
	  <name>hubris</name>
	  <meaning>excessive pride</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Bernard Madoff showed hubris in believing he could deceive so many investors forever; nemesis came when his fraud was discovered and he was imprisoned for life.</example>
	  <etymology>hubris was the term given by the Greeks to describe the behaviour of anyone whose excessive pride led him or her to challenge the gods. Excessive pride is traditionally punished by the equal and opposite force of retributive justice; the Greeks called this power nemesis; the contemporary expression 'pride comes before a fall' also describes this relationship. So, such a display of hubris by Bernard Madoff - who thought he could fool all of the people all of the time - was always going to be punished by nemesis.</etymology>
	  <pronunciation>hubris</pronunciation>

	  <name>Hydra</name>
	  <meaning>a problem that is hard to conquer because it will not go away</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Trying to stop the spread of AIDS in Africa is like trying to kill the Hydra; there may be short-lived successes but, sadly, the problem seems perennial.</example>
	  <etymology>The Lernaean Hydra was in Greek mythology a sea monster with many heads who guarded an underwater entrance to the Underworld. If one of its heads was chopped off, two would grow back in its place; but there was hope for anyone seeking to vanquish the Hydra in combat as only one of its heads was immortal. As one of his 12 labours, Hercules had to defeat the Hydra. He did this by chopping off each head, then by having his nephew cauterise each stump to prevent regrowth. Hercules then pushed a huge rock on top of the immortal head. Today, we continue to refer to a problem that seems impossible to overcome as a Hydra.

Kafka's most famous novel, The Trial, tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by an enigmatic authority; but he never finds out what he has done wrong.

	  <etymology>laconic originates from a place in Greece called 'Laconia' (to which the Greeks give the adjective Lakonikos).

In the novel, Gulliver is washed up on the island of Lilliput, and implored by the tiny Lilliputians to fight the people on a neighbouring island. The island of Lilliput was used by Swift to parody England at the time. For example, Swift talks about a conflict in Lilliput between those people who prefer to open an egg from its big end and those people who opt for the small end; this is a reference to the ongoing arguments in England between the Catholics (the 'Big-Endians') and the Protestants (the 'Little-Endians').

	  <etymology>malapropism derives from the name of the character Mrs Malaprop in Richard Sheridan's play The Rivals (1775). Mys Malaprop has the habit of getting words confused, which is a source of humour in the play. Her name was chosen because of the link to the French phrase mal a propos, which means 'ill-suited' and describes perfectly the jumbled order of her words. Today, when we say that someone has committed a malapropism, we mean they are guilty of a similar linguistic slip-up.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. George Bush spoke about certain countries forming an 'axis of evil': this implies he sees the world in Manichaean terms, with the USA being 'good', and these other mentioned countries as being 'evil'.</example>
	  <etymology>Manichaean derives from 'Manichaeism', a 3rd-century religion that was one of the most popular in the world at the time. This religion was based on the teachings of the Iranian prophet Mani who was privy to divine truths from a spirit who visited him. Manichaeism is distinguished by its viewing the world as a clear-cut struggle between good (or 'spiritually'); and evil (or 'materialism'); today, when we call someone Manichaean, we mean they see the world as being divided very clearly between good and evil.</etymology>

Tired of having to deal with fickle mercenaries, Martinet devised a rigorous programme to turn members of the public into effective military servicemen. It is a cruel irony that this paragon of discipline was killed by 'friendly fire': a fatal form of ill-discipline. Today, the word martinet refers to any disciplinarian.</etymology>

	  <etymology>A menagerie was a 16th-century French term used to describe a collection of exotic animals kept in captivity; the French word menagerie is derived from the word menage, meaning 'a household'. A menagerie was often retained by a royal court, no so much as to study the animal world but rather to signify the opulence of the menagerie's owner (as exotic animals were very expensive to purchase). Today, menagerie refers to any diverse collection of things or people.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. Angelina Jolie does much charity work for landmine victims: she is a celebrity who exercises noblesse oblige</example>
	  <etymology>In his novel Le Lys dans la vallee (which translates as The Lily of the Valley), the 19th century French novelist Balzac summarises his advice to a rich young man by the two words: 'noblesse oblige!'. This phrase - which literally means 'nobility creates obligations' - is cited today as a reminder that, with great wealth comes great responsibility: the rich have a duty to help the poor. Today, we use the phrase noblesse oblige to remind someone who has enjoyed success that they should help others who have fared less well.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. The police shone infrared lights inside Fred West's home, revealing palimpests of bloodstains that the serial killer had sought to wash away</example>
	  <etymology>palimpest literally refers to an ancient Roman manuscript on which the original writing had been rubbed away to make room for later writing (as was the Roman custom); hence the Greek etymology, palin 'again', and psestos: 'scraped' - so palimpest literally means 'scraped (clean and used) again'. However the original writing was not lost forever; with the passing of time, the faint outlines of the earlier writing would reappear with sufficient clarity for scholars to read it. Today, we use palimpest to describe an object that displays its past (as well as its present) - for example, our brain is the ultimate palimpest, retaining so much information about our past while also accounting for our present behaviour.</etymology>

He is a tutor charged with educating the young Candide, who lives in beautiful surrounds; Pangloss is an optimistic teacher whose mantra is as follows: 'all is for the best in the best possible of worlds'. Candide eventually leaves his pampered existence and witnesses such suffering in the world that he abandons  Pangloss's rosy world view in favour of his own pragmatic philosophy, which is: 'all you can do is tend your own garden'.

The touchstone in question was black quartz (a semi-precious mineral), which was used for testing the quality of gold alloys by rubbing them on it and then comparing the streak left behind by the gold alloy with a streak left by pure gold (which leaves a clear yellow line behind). Gradually paragon assumed its current figurative usage, referring today to a model of excellence by which other people or things must be judged.

	  <example>e.g. Novelists are fond of using pathetic fallacy; an example can be found in the use of the expression 'the sky is weeping' instead of the more conventional 'it is raining'</example>
	  <etymology>pathetic fallacy is composed of the Greek word pathos, meaning 'the quality that arouses pity', and the Latin word fallere: to deceive. As a pathetic fallacy refers to depicting non-human things in a human light (which is a popular activity of artists), it is no surprise that it was an art critic. John Ruskin, who coined the term, noting in his book Modern Painters (1856) that the pathetic fallacy had as its aim 'to signify any description of inanimate natural objects that ascribes to them human capabilities...'. An everyday example of a pathetic fallacy is when someone looks up and says of the rain falling from above: 'the sky is weeping'.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. When I see my wife putting on her apron, I start salivating - before she has even touched any food - due to a Pavlovian response to that apron of hers</example>
	  <etymology>Pavlovian is an expression deriving from the work of Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936), a Russian scientist who won the Nobel Prize. Pavlov noted that dogs salivate when food is presented to them; far more significantly, he also noticed that - if you ring a bell seconds before presenting the food - eventually the bell alone will be enough to produce the salivation (even if no food is ever presented). Thus Pavlov concluded that some responses by an animal are based on that animal's previous experiences (and are not just based on an animal's reflexes). Today, we use the word Pavlovian to describe any response within us that we can only explain owing to a past experience coming to the fore (rather than owing to our reaction to a present stimulus outside of ourselves).

Today, we continue to use this word to describe any group of people who look the same and stay close together - such as photographers awaiting a celebrity at a film premi√®re, or bodyguards surrounding a president.

In the New Testament, the Pharisees are presented as rule-followers, in contrast to Jesus who is concerned only with expressing God's love. For example, the Pharisees ostracise sinners, whereas Jesus actively seeks them out. Today, we use the word pharisaic to refer to anyone who displays self-righteousness in their obsession with following the rules.</etymology>

	  <etymology>
	  Nowadays, phlegm is used to mean 'mucus discharged from the mouth'. However, the ancient Greeks used the word differently: for them, phlegm was one of four body fluids that account for our mood (the Greek word was phlegma, meaning 'an inflammation', reflecting the fact that phlegm was also supposed to be the cause of many diseases). Phlegm was believed to be associated with a calm, near apathetic, temperament. This sense persists in the meaning of the word phlegmatic today, which we use to describe someone who does not get rattled easily.</etymology>

His mother, Aphrodite, when pregnant with Priapos, won a beauty competition. The goddess who lost out to Aphrodite was so annoyed that she proceeded to curse Aphrodite's son, Priapos - who was still in the womb - to be born with a foul mind. As a result, when Priapos emerged into the world, he had an erection that would never subside. Today, we continue to refer to oversexed males as being priapic.</etymology>

If they were too long for the bed, he would chop their legs off; if they were too short, he would stretch their limbs. in the event that someone was the perfect fit for his bed, Procrustes had a differently-proportioned bed that he kept in reserve and would produce the one that was the worst fit for his victim, thus, guaranteeing some form of torture would ensue.

	  <meaning>prose that is excessively ornate</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Barbara Cartland might have shifted 500m copies of her romantic novels, but critics didn't like her writing, describing it as purple prose.</example>
	  <etymology>purple prose was term used by the Romans to describe fancy writing. The phrase came about because, in Roman times, purple dye was very expensive to manufacture because it necessitated the crushing of tens of thousands of molluscs (types of shellfish). Consequently, it was only the Emperor and the very wealthy who could afford purple garments. However, certain social climbers developed the habit of sewing small bits of purple onto their robes to give themselves a 'touch of class'. This activity was considered pretentious. In 65 BC, the poet Horace harnessed the negative connotations of the colour purple when he described pretentious writing as purple and this phrase is still used today.</etymology>

	  <etymology>quixotic derives from the name of Don Quixote, the hero of the famous 17th-century Spanish novel of the same name by the author Miguel de Cervantes. Don Quixote is a retired country gentleman who develops an obsession with tales of chivalry. Eventually he becomes delusional and, designating a neighbour as his squire and a farm girl as his ladylove, he embarks on a series of adventures. At the height of hos madness he attacks some windmills, believing them to be giants (Incidentally, this episode is the genesis of our modern-day expression 'tilting at windmmills', which means 'fighting an imaginary opponent'). Eventually he undergoes a return to sanity but is left feeling melancholic and dies a broken man.

	  <meaning>a system of politics based on a practical - rather than a moral - approach</meaning>
	  <example>Before he became Prime Minister, the press often accused David Cameron of tailoring his views to suit public opinion and of other instances of realpolitik.</example>
	  <etymology>realpolitik refers to the implementation of a form of politics that is pragmatic - often at the expense of moral considerations. The first practitioner of realpolitik was Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor to Wilhelm I of the Kingdom of Prussia (a landmass covering parts of Germany and Russia); for example, keen to ensure the election of a Pope favourable to his own political aims, von Bismarck had no qualms about attempting to manipulate the Papal elections during the 1870s. Modern proponents include Richard Nixon who, for example, tolerated the human rights' violations of China as this meant greater global stability. Today, when we describe someone as practising realpolitik, we mean they are pragmatic - rather than principled - individuals; in other words, they are Machiavellian.</etymology>

	  <etymology>rococo describes many different forms of art, including music, architecture and woodwork. The rococo movement reached its peak in 18th-century Continental Europe and was characterised in furniture design by ornate spiral lines - hence the word's etymology from the French la rocaille, which means 'a garden made of rocks' (another example of an elaborate man-made creation). Examples of rococo art include the Palace of Versailles and the music of Vivaldi. Today, we continue to describe any intricate artwork as rococo.</etymology>

	  <name>Ruritanian</name>
	  <meaning>an inhabitant of Ruritania, a fictional country used by politicians and lawyers to illustrate a hypothetical case - especially if a reall country would object to be used in the example being considered</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. If France and Germany sign a security pact, this means these two countries will defend each other in case of attack by, say, the Ruritarians.</example>
	  <etymology>Ruritania was the name given by novelist Anthony Pope to a fictitious European country in his novel The Prisoner of Zenda (1894). Within literature, the word Ruritania has since been used to conjure up a fictitious country in Europe abounding with fairly-tale notions of chivalry and romance (as per Pope's novel). For example, Evelyn Waugh describes one character in his novel Vile Bodies as a sad 'ex-King of Ruritania'. Today, the fictional country of Ruritania is most often used in a more practical context: namely by politicians and lawyers to illustrate a hypothetical case - especially if a real country would object to being used in the example being considered.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. Comedian Lewis Grizzard once sardonically commented: 'Instead of getting married again, I'm going to find a woman I don't like and just give her the house'.</example>
	  <etymology>sardonic derives from the ancient Greeks' belief that eating a certain plant from the country of Sardo (which was the Greek's name for Sardinia) would cause facial contortions that resembled those of sardonic laughter; death usually followed. Today, we continue to use sardonic to mean 'grimly cynical'; and 'gallows humour' (i.e. humour arising from life-threatening situations) is one manifestation of a sardonic sense of humour.</etymology>

	  <meaning>(of a person) slow and dark (in colouring) and melancholic</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Henry VIII's weight gain in old age made him slow and depressed: he had become saturnine.</example>
	  <etymology>Saturnine derives from the medieval Latin Saturninus, which means 'of Saturn'. In medieval times, Saturn was considered by astrologers to be the coldest and darkest of the planets because it was thought to be the furthest from the sun. When we describe someone as saturnine today, we summon up these negative qualities.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. For his 12th birthday, Elvis Presley wanted a bike but his mother could only afford a guitar: this proved to be a serendipitous gift for someone as musically talented as 'The King'.</example>
	  <etymology>serendipitous derives from the title of The Three Princes of Serendip, the English version of a fairy tale published in Venice in 1557 and to which author Horace Walpole referred in a letter he wrote in 1754. In the story, the three princes had a habit of stumbling across good things, or, as Walpole put it: 'were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in the quest of'. Today, we use the word serendipitous to describe any chance event with a similarly joyful outcome.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. By using the shibboleth of a 'just war' to describe his invasion of Iraq, Tony Blair is attempting to frame his actions within a wider religious and historical context.</example>
	  <etymology>shibboleth originates from a particularly bloody account in the Old Testament. In the passage (Judges 12:6), the Gileadites are pursuing the fleeing Ephraimites, whom the Gileadites have just defeated in battle. To identify a man as an Ephraimite, the Gileadites would ask him to say the word shibboleth (which means 'an ear of corn' in Hebrew); the Ephraimites could not pronounce this word correctly because they lacked a 'sh' sound in their dialect. Ephraimites would therefore fail the pronunciation test and then be slaughtered. Today, shibboleth is used to describe any phrase particular to a narrow group of people (such as 'credit derivatives', a phrase only bankers would claim to understand) or an experience common to one group (such as circumcision in the Jewish faith).</etymology>

	  <meaning>something given to pacify (such as a bribe)</meaning>
	  <example>e.g. Bankers, at government-supported banks, complain that plans to cut their bonuses are a sop to angry taxpayers, say critics.</example>
	  <etymology>A sop meant 'bread dipped in liquid' in Middle English. The current sense of sop as being something designed to pacify someone came from the epic poem The Aeneid, written by Virgil (70-19BC). At one point in the Aeneid, the hero Aeneas decides to enter the underworld to see his dead father. Aeneas consults the guardian to the underworld, a prophetess called 'the Sibyl'. Knowing that the underworld is patrolled by a monstrous dog 'the Sibyl' prepares a sop soaked in honey and drugs to stupefy this animal; the plan works and the sop renders the dog comatose. Hence, today, a sop continues to mean 'something given to pacify' and often describes a small thing done as a concession to appease someone whose main demands are not being met.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. Inspector Morse's perpetual whisky-induced hangover perhaps explained why he was so splenetic.</example>
	  <etymology>splenetic derives from the Latin word splen, which means 'spleen'. This is because the ancient Greeks believed that the spleen - which is an organ involved in the creation and removal of blood cells - produced black bile which could darken someone's mood. Today, we continue to describe someone as splenetic if that person is in a strop.</etymology>

Reverend Spooner was notorious for confusing the letters at the start of adjacent words. For example, he is alleged to have said in church: 'The lord is my shoving leopard'. Today, we use the word spoonerism to describe any instance of someone confusing the letters at the start of adjacent words.</etymology>

	  <example>e.g. Arnold Schwarzenegger was chosen to star in action films because of his muscular physique and stentorian voice.</example>
	  <etymology>stentorian derives from the name of a man called Stentor, who in Greek mythology was the herald for the Greek forces during the Trojan War. In his work The Odyssey, Greek poet Homer notes that the loudness of Stentor's voice was equal to that of fifty men combined; however, Stentor's voice was not louder that a god's and he shouted himself to death during an unsuccessful attempt to defeat the god Hermes in a shouting contest. Today, the adjective stentorian is used to describe someone with a booming voice.</etymology>

The most famous piece of literature of the time was Goethe's Die Leiden des jungen Werthers (The Suffering of Young Werther), a novel which describes a man so lovelorn that he kills himself.

However, Puritans consider lace to look seedy and so it was that Saint Audrey - and the word tawdry that is a contraction of her name - became associated with tackiness.

	  <etymology>triumvirate derives from the Latin trium virum, the genetive plural of tres viri: three men; troika derives from the Russian troe: set of three. The so-called First Triumvirate was an informal political alliance of Julius Caesar, Pompeius Magnus ("Pompey the Great") and Marcus Crassus. The arrangement had no legal status, and its purpose was to consolidate the political power of the three and their supporters against the senatorial elite. After the death of Crassus in 53 BC, the two survivors fought a civil war, during which Pompey was killed and Caesar established his sole rule as perpetual dictator. The Second Triumvirate was recognized as a triumvirate at the time. A Lex Titia formalized the rule of Octavian, Mark Antony, and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. The legal language makes reference to the traditional tresviri. This "three-man commission for restoring the constitution of the republic" (tresviri rei publicae constituendae) in fact was given the power to make or annul law without approval from either the Senate or the people; their judicial decisions were not subject to appeal, and they named magistrates at will. Although the constitutional machinery of the Republic was not irrevocably dismantled by the Lex Titia, in the event it never recovered. Lepidus was sidelined early in the triumvirate, and Antony was eliminated in civil war, leaving Octavian the sole leader.</etymology>

In Of the Best State of a Republic and of the New Island Utopia (1516), More depicts the island of Utopia as a landmass where harmony reigns thanks to its perfect social and political structure.

(The word vaudeville's formation in France can be traced to the most famous writer of such songs who lived in the valley of Vire, or, in French, the Vau de Vire). It was variety theatre owners in the US who adapted the expression vaudeville at the end of the 19th century in the hope that the Frenchness of the term might lend the halls an air of sophistication and thus differentiate them in the public's mind from the earlier variety halls which were marked by rowdiness. Today vaudeville refers to any entertainment made up of a series of short musical sketches and with a light-hearted theme.</etymology>
